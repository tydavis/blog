# About Me

![Headshot of myself][1]

I realized the sheer body of research and analysis that I had produced
over the last decade is locked away inside the wikis, emails, and
chatrooms of companies with whom I am no longer employed or have
dissolved. I also hate having to "reinvent the wheel" without a good
reason.

Storing (the sanitized parts of) my research and experiences here will
keep me from having to do exactly that. Also, it serves as a useful
platform to document opinions and progression of said opinions over
time.
