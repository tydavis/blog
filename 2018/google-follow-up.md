# Google Follow-up

A lot of people with whom I've shared my journal entry were confused as to why
I would rage-quit Google entirely when I was upset with only one piece of the
company. 

Normally I wouldn't. Normally, I would just pivot my usage over to another
provider, stop using the offending service, and get on with life. What's
different now is that rage-quitting is often the only way to get traction on
much of anything these days. If I didn't rage-quit, nobody would respond,
nobody would notice.

Google's divisions care about their bottom line and their publicity. By publicly
[saying they are terrible][1], I get the opportunity to get *some* kind of
response from Google.  That didn't happen here, but then again, Google doesn't
really care about individuals unless they're huge influencers, in which case
they'd also like to hire you... 

The short of it is, we still have enough alternatives to choose a different
option. Until we get to the point where [companies aren't allowed][2] to have such
[significant market power (again)][3], companies will end up reaching a size
where they don't care about their detractors and stop innovating. Hence Google.

I'll leave you with a quote. It's more political, but everything is getting
political these days:

>>“The personal, as everyone’s so fucking fond of saying, is political. So if
>>some idiot politician, some power player, tries to execute policies that harm
>>you or those you care about, take it personally. Get angry. The Machinery of
>>Justice will not serve you here – it is slow and cold, and it is theirs,
>>hardware and soft-. Only the little people suffer at the hands of Justice; the
>>creatures of power slide from under it with a wink and a grin. If you want
>>justice, you will have to claw it from them. Make it personal. Do as much
>>damage as you can. Get your message across. That way, you stand a better chance
>>of being taken seriously next time. Of being considered dangerous. And make no
>>mistake about this: being taken seriously, being considered dangerous marks the
>>difference - the only difference in their eyes - between players and little
>>people. Players they will make deals with. Little people they liquidate. And
>>time and again they cream your liquidation, your displacement, your torture and
>>brutal execution with the ultimate insult that it’s just business, it’s
>>politics, it’s the way of the world, it’s a tough life and that it’s nothing
>>personal. Well, fuck them. Make it personal.
