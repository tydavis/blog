# Life in Chrome (Part 2)

>Published on 2017-04-04

It has been over a month since I've switched to using Chrome for all of my work
and I think I've found my happy place.

[Cloud9][1] is a fantastic editor and, by [following C9's official
directions][2], I've been able to set up the C9 IDE for both work and home. *No,
I am not giving c9.io access to my work machine.* Yes, it is awesome to be able
to call up a complete editor+terminal without a bunch of SSH keys. And the
vim/emacs keybindings are spot-on.

I still haven't resolved my [DNS concerns][3] yet, but [HTTPSEverywhere][4] and
[uBlock Origin][5] are doing a bang-up job of keeping my connections secured and
cutting out the ads. I think what I'll need to do for my home is set up a
[RaspberryPI 3][6] for my home DNS instead. I've had some issues getting the
[C2000T][7] to honor my settings and *not* add itself as the DNS resolver, but I
have time on my side. If it comes to the worst situation, I'll buy my own
gigabit-capable wired router.

Finally, after testing [each of the streaming music services][8] out there, I
have settled on Google Play/YouTube. They are the *only* services that managed
to work reliably as HTTPS-only. I'm aware that Google is an Ad company by
itself, but there's only so much I can do about protecting myself there. I'm
already a [Project Fi][9] subscriber, [GMail][10] user, and a [Google Cloud
Platform][11] subscriber. They already have most of my data. My opposition is
with [CenturyLink][12] deciding that they have a right to my data.
