# Ranting about these Whole30 articles

>Published 2017-05-17

I am sick and tired of articles [like this one][1] from [Glamour.com][2].

> "I did Whole30, but I really didn't because I half-assed the program and then
> completely gave up when my family visited. Now I've invented the Whole15!"

Ok, that doesn't quite convey the reality of the issue, so let me share with you
her own words:

> ...
> If you half-ass it, they say, it doesn't count.
>
>But I'm going to be honest with you now: I half-assed it here and there. Almond
>milk is very gross, and I quickly returned to soy as my preferred morning latte
>ingredient, bean ban be damned. I didn't ask at restaurants whether my piece of
>fish was cooked in butter. And if a lentil found its way into my veggie mix,
>who was I to remove it? I really did leave dairy, sugar (including my beloved
>Diet Coke), and gluten behind, but I refused to stick to a "healthy" eating
>plan that didn't permit rice cakes and peanut butter. If rice cakes and peanut
>butter are wrong, I do not wish to be right.

Let's get a few things straight:

1. Eating "approximately 1,000 Larabars at every meal" fails the spirit/intent
   of Whole30. That alone fails you out of the program.
1. Eating rice, peanut butter, or any amount of soy **automatically fails the
   program.**
1. Bottom line: You failed the [Whole30][3] and you did not complete a
   [Whole9][4] or even a Whole15.
1. You didn't "invent" the Whole15. That's [been around for a while][5], and
   *you didn't do that either.*

Why am I emphasizing the fact that you failed, despite your admission of failure
in your very first paragraph? Because you were *still* incorrect when you said
you made it 15 days. Your program ended the **second** you put soy creamer in
your coffee, or ate a buttered fish, or let a little lentil into your salad.
When did *those* things happen? What was it, eight or nine days in? You never
said so in the article.

When it comes to doing a Whole15, you *plan* to end your program at the
appropriate time, then you follow through. Even Melissa Hartwig herself said you
can complete shortened versions of whatever length you think appropriate:

> "If you've done at least three full Whole30 programs, been working hard to
> maintain your new healthy habits, and just need a little reminder/pick me
> up/kick in the pants, a shortened version of the Whole30 may be just the
> ticket to help you accomplish some short-term health and habit goals."
> -Melissa Hartwig

Instead, you decided to rationalize the program failure and claim you did a
"Whole 15." Bullshit. Anybody who "modifies" the program or decides they can
have "just a little" **isn't doing the program.** There are no cheats, there are
no exceptions, and you don't get to say you "did it halfway" if you violate
those rules. You aren't allowed to claim you did anything remotely "Whole 30" if
you *change the program.*

[Elizabeth Logan][6], you and those like you have lied and are deliberately
deceiving the rest of the world with your lie.

**Stop it.**
