# Google Sites

>Published on 2017-08-01

I've made [so](/view/gluecode/2017/shifting-blogging-engines)
[many](/view/gluecode/2017/blog-on-a-diet) changes to this blog/website that
this should scarcely be a surprise for anyone any more.

While normally I would be serving off of my "naked domain" ([gluecode.net][3]) I
instead elected to redirect the root of my blog to Google Sites and forego
[purchasing the GSuite][6] for my domain. Reasons for this include:

- Transferring data and information from [tydavis@gmail.com][4] would have been
    difficult or impossible (including Play Store, purchased storage space, and
    \~20GB of data migration).
- [Naked domain][5] setup might be possible using basic domains.google.com
    records.

While I said I'd much rather "roll up my sleeves" and present exactly what I
want, this isn't markedly worse than my original work. It adapts to mobile
display without issue. I can embed maps, calendars, and youtube links at will. I
can add Google objects (Docs, Slides, etc) and regardless it all reads cleanly
on the screen.

I'm sure that I'll find something wrong with Sites in the future, but for now,
I'm going to keep watching Gophercon videos like the one below.
