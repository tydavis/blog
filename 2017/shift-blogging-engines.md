# Shift back to blogger/ghost

> Published on 2017-03-04

I've been migrating this blog between various systems for years. I've used,
Jekyll, most recently, and each time I've thought the new generator would give
me something I needed or wanted.

In the end what *really* matters is the content, and I feel that in my pursuit
of these technologies, I lost that.

I\'ve migrated off of my old domain and, due to a lack of import options in
Blogger, had to copy-paste my posts and formatting in to the blogger editor. For
the record, the Blogger editor kinda sucks, but when the editor sucks, you just
learn how to work with it -- [practicing what I preach!][1]

Update: This blog is now running through [Ghost][2] & [Caddy][3], on one of my
hosts in Google Cloud Platform, which provides automatic TLS and http2 support.
