# Final Chromebook Prep

>Published 2017-06-13

In preparation for the arrival of my [new chromebook][1] I'm doing a final
review and backup of my data. Not surprisingly, it's all been backed up and
current for months.

The downside to this is that I need to sell my existing laptop *and* start
removing my personal items from my work laptop. Some could argue that I
shouldn't have had *personal data* on my *work-provided laptop* anyway, but the
reality is that the lines between work and home have been blurred by companies
and employees alike for decades.

That means it's time to sit down, take a long, deep dive into my machines, and
see what needs to go where. I think the hardest part is going to be building up
another server with utilities -- in my case, I need Libreoffice (or something
like it) that can reliably read and reformat DOCX files into Word97-compatible
DOC formats. Why? Because Google Drive appears to have lost its touted and
much-valued Word-conversion abilities, and my online courses don't know how to
build/write documents in a more compatible format.

Alright, enough yapping. Time to get to work.
