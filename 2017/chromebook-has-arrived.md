# Chromebook has arrived

> Published on 2017-06-14

With what I can only describe as an *obscene* amount of excitement, I've
unwrapped my new [Samsung Chromebook Plus][1] and it's everything I could have
asked for. Typing is fluid and feels like it will retain that crispness, the
display is ridiculously bright, and even my weird "use the search key as a
control key" setting has migrated over to this baby.

Oh yes, I'm writing this new post on the device. It's definitely in a position
to become my daily-driver (minus the times when work requires that I use their
hardware).

Some negatives at this time include:

1. The keyboard is ever so slightly cramped compared to the rMBP, but that's due
   to the 3:2 aspect ratio.
1. The screen is just so damned BRIGHT it burns my eyeballs a little
1. Chunky webpages like Inbox and Slack are taking just a few seconds to load
   and "get smooth," but admittedly this happens to my quad-core i7 laptop, and
   to my rMBP, so no real change there. (Ok, I was hoping for a little more out
   of this OP1 processor, but who am I kidding...)

Overall I believe I am and will remain extremely pleased with this purchase,
especially once I finish my Coursera classes and can get to work on more
development projects!
