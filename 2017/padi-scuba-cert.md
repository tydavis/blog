# PADI Scuba Open Water certified

> Published on 2017-07-10

I finally got [Open Water Certified][1] with [Seattle Scuba][2]. The instructors
and divemasters were amazing, and I highly recommend that people who love to
explore and adventure give it a try. At the very least, you have a whole new
respect for those divers you see in the movies!

For what it's worth, I've been bitten by the diving bug. All it took was the
final dive. After doing all the skills and confirming I can handle myself
through all the basic scenarios, we buddied-up and investigated the bottom of
Cove 1 in West Seattle (just off to the left of [Salty's][3] on Alki beach).
It's crab season, and there is *so much* down there to see...

After having a chat with my wife, we've agreed to get our [Night Diver][4], [Dry
Suit][5], and [Advanced Open Water][6] training. It's just a matter of "when!"
