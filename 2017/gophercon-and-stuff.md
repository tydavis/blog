# Gophercon 2017 and other stuff

>Published on 2017-07-24

Keeping this post a bit short. Gophercon 2017 has [released its videos on
Youtube][1] in a convenient playlist. I'm about 7 videos in and I have to say
the talks are fantastic. Definitely worth watching.

Also, in the interest of keeping private things private, I have moved this blog
and other repositories into my private [Gitlab account][2]. I'll be leaving only
my most public and reasonably curated things on Github.

Finally, don't underestimate the power of taking a break. This last weekend my
wife and I spent an overnight in [Twin Harbors State Park][3], with easy access
to the beach. While my back and sides have protested the mat on which I slept,
my brain was *on* when I got back to the house. From that I've been able to
write better, code more clearly and directly, and exert more willpower.
